# MRF-Stock-Price-Prediction-with-ARIMA-and-LSTM

Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing advanced analytics techniques to predict stock prices, a crucial aspect of financial decision-making in today's dynamic market environment. This project is an industrial assignment I undertook during the first year of my MBA in Business Analytics course in February of 2024. It was designed to provide practical experience with predictive analytics, time-series forecasting, and AIML. The project aimed to equip me with the necessary skills and insights required to navigate the complexities of real-world data analysis and decision-making processes within the financial domain.

Project Components

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Acquiring historical stock data and preparing it for analysis, the datasets were obtained from Yahoo Finance.
Model Development: Implementing machine learning models (LSTM, ARIMA) for time series forecasting.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using various evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE).
Comparison of Models: Comparing LSTM and ARIMA models to determine their effectiveness in predicting stock prices.
Future Scope: Identifying areas for further improvement and enhancement in model accuracy and reliability.


Repository Structure

Predictive Analysis for MRF Stock .ipynb: Python script containing the implementation of the stock market prediction models.
MRF Weekly Stock Prices Data 1st July 2002 to 2nd Feb 2024 (Used in code).csv: Dataset file containing historical stock price data. (I have used the weekly dataset but have also included Monthly and Daily dataset)
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its components.

Usage

To replicate the results or further develop the project:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
Run the script to execute the models on the provided dataset.

Conclusion

While the project presented valuable learning opportunities, it also revealed certain limitations and challenges encountered during the predictive modeling process. Despite the successful performance of the LSTM model, the ARIMA model failed to yield accurate predictions, as evidenced by poor evaluation metrics. With an MSE of 0.07, MAE of 0.22, RMSE of 0.27, and MAPE of 1.88%, the ARIMA model's performance fell short of expectations. These discrepancies underscore the inherent uncertainties and complexities involved in stock market forecasting. Moving forward, further research and refinement are warranted to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictive models in this domain.
